## Introduction  

With over 7 years experience in proffessional IT environments and now a completed bachelor's in computer science, this portfolio is a space to showcase my growth in software development principles. In my work with IT organizations both large and small I have gained appreciation for the need to research new skills and methods for solving problems. Technology is a tool to be used for finding logical solutions that both adhere to development best practices as well as real world considerations. Solving day to day problems can often fit the form of scripting for repitive or lengthy tasks. 

This portfolio starts with a retrospective code review of some of my earlier work in Python and SQL. Since then I have learned much about designing software, particularly how it can help with real world applications of data analysis and validation. Similarly, intelligent software should include efficent algorithms that limit how much we need to examine data both for the protection of that data and the efficiency of operations. And finally, working with data implies a secure connection to a database that cannot be misused by malicious actors. 

## Sample Project

On the following pages I've included a sample project that envisions a scenario whereby Excel is being used to collect customer contact information. The sample project was developed with best practices in mind and to provide an example solution for validating and storing data manually entered into structured Excel workbooks.

## Code Review

On this page I have placed a code review of some earlier work in Python and SQL that comes from my now completed bachelorâ€™s program of computer science. This review covers important considerations such as security and overall soundness of design, some of which is clearly missed in this initial example.
